<H>PREFACE.
<P>This Dictionary has been undertaken to supply a want long felt by the student of a complete
and at the same time cheap Sanskrit-English Dictionary. Very little need, I think, be said with regard
to the necessity of bringing out a work like this, when the study of Sanskrit has received such a strong
impetus during the last twenty-five years. There have been four or five Sanskrit-English Dictionaries <lbinfo n="pub+lished"/>
published till now; but very few of them fulfil the two essential conditions of the popularity and usefulness of
such works: --satisfying all the requirements of students and at the same time being within their easy reach.
The Dictionaries of Professors Wilson and Monier Williams are very useful and valuable works, but their
prices-particularly of the latter-are prohibitively high, and they do not also meet many of the most ordinary
wants of Sanskrit readers. A student, while reading Sanskrit at School or College, generally expects that the
Dictionary which he uses will give appropriate equivalents for such words and compound expressions as
may have peculiar meanings or shades of meaning in particular passages. He desires to know not only that
a particular word has so many senses, but that it has this or that sense in a particular passage of a
book, so that he may determine any particular meaning of a word in a certain passage by seeing and
comparing how it is used elsewhere by the same writer or by other writers in different works. He also
wants accurate and, as far as possible, full explanations of the more important technical terms <lbinfo n="occur+ring"/>
occurring at least in his usual course reading, as well as any other information likely to be of use to him.
Professor Monier Williams has, in his invaluable Dictionary, tried to exhaust the meanings of words as far as
he could, and has also given much useful information on some points. But it would not, I think, be detracting
from the merits of the great work to say that it fails to give some of the most common senses of words <lbinfo n="occur+ring"/>
occurring in such well-known and oft-read books as the Uttararāmacarita, Mudrārākṣasa, Veṇīsaṃhāra,
Śiśupālavadha or Kādambarī, Moreover it gives neither quotations nor references, nor much of the <lbinfo n="in+formation"/>
information likely to be useful to the student during his School or College career. In making these <lbinfo n="re+marks"/>
remarks I must not, in the slightest degree, be understood to make any reflections on that Dictionary. Indeed, I
have myself derived no small help from that work, as will be acknowledged further on. My only object
in pointing out its defects has been to show why I thought it necessary to undertake the <lbinfo n="compila+tion"/>
compilation of a new Dictionary, when some already existed in the field, and I hope the reader will be able
to find that this Dictionary is an improvement on its predecessors in some respects at least.
<P>Having thus explained the necessity of undertaking and publishing this Dictionary, I shall say a
few words with regard to its plan and scope. The extent of Sanskrit literature is so vast that not even the
life-long labours of a single individual, howsoever talented or persevering, will be able to do full justice to it.
It has two distinct branches, the Vedic and post-Vedic, each of which will require an independent encyclopædia
for itself. Not even the gigantic {%Vācaspatya%} of the late Professor Tārānātha Tarkavācaspati, nor the
equally gigantic German {%Wörterbuch%} of Drs. Roth and Bothlingk, can be said to be altogether complete and
comprehensive. Much less can a small work like mine-complied during the leisure hours
of a teacher's life-aspire to be called complete in any sense of the word. However, I have
tried to make it as comprehensive and practically useful to the student of Sanskrit as
my humble powers enabled me to do, though how far I have succeeded in my object the reader alone can
best decide. It includes all words occurring in the general post-Vedic literature, such as Epics like
the Rāmāyaṇa and Mahābhārata, the several Purāṇas, the Smṛti literature, particularly the law-books of
Manu and Yājñavalkya, the several darśanas or systems of philosophy such as Nyāya, Vaiśeṣika, Mīmāṃsā,
Vedānta, &c. Grammar, Rhetoric, Poetry in all its branches, Tantra and dramatic literature, Mathematics,
Medicine, Astronomy, Music, and such other technical or scientific branches of learning. It inserts most 
[Page-2+ 51]
of the leading names of trees and plants with scientific or vernacular equivalents wherever noteworthy.
It also gives most of the principal Vedic words or senses of words; for though Vedic Literature would
require a dictionary by itself, still I did not think it desirable to omit altogether at least such words as <lbinfo n="fre+quently"/>
frequently occur, especially as I intended to make this work as complete and comprehensive as I could. For the
same reason, obscure or unimportant words or senses of words have been inserted, though they may not be
generally met with in classical literature as studied by the University student.
<P>The chief feature of this Dictionary is that it has aimed at being {%practical%}. With this view I have
added quotations and references to the peculiar and noteworthy senses of words, especially such as occur in
works read by the student at School or College. In some cases the quotations might appear to some to
be superfluous, but to a student, especially a beginner, they are very useful, as they supply him with
apt illustrations of the senses of words, and enable him to provide himself with a large stock of
choice, idiomatic expressions which are so abundant in the language. Another noticeable feature of the
Dictionary is that it gives full explanations of the more important technical terms, particularly in Nyāya,
Alaṃkāra, Vedānta, Grammar and Dramaturgy, with quotations in Sanskrit wherever necessary; {%e. g%}.
see the words {#anEkAMtika, aBAva, sAmAnya, aprastutapraSaMsA, upamA, rUpaka, upanizad, mImAMsA, aDyAropa, vArtika, pada#},
{#prAtipadika, spfzwa, rasa, praveSaka, vizkaMBaka, sTAyiBAva#} &c. In the case of Alaṃkāras I have chiefly drawn upon
the Kāvyaprakāśa, though I have occasionally consulted the Rasagaṅgādhara, Candrāloka and <lbinfo n="Kuvala+yānanda"/>
Kuvalayānanda. In the explanation of dramatic terms I have usually followed the Sāhityadarpaṇa and its
translation into English, and have sometimes referred to the Daśarūpa. Similarly, striking phrases, some
choice expressions and idioms or peculiar combinations of words, have been given under every word where
necessary or possible; {%e. g%}. see the words {#gam, setu, mayUra, hasta, DA, kf, dA, baMD#}, &c. Mythological allusions
in the case of all important personages have been briefly but clearly explained, so as to give the reader
most of the facts connected with them; {%e. g%}. see {#agni, agastya, iMdra, kArtikeya, prahrAda, sAvitrI#} &c. Etymology
has generally been given in the case of every important word, except where it was purely fanciful; {%e. g%}. see
{#ajIvani, atiTi, apatya, putra, jAyA, hfzIkeSa#} &c. In doing this I have followed the system of native <lbinfo n="gramma+rians"/>
grammarians who resolve every word into its {%‘prakriti’%} and {%‘pratyaya’%}, and the terminations given according to
Pāṇini's nomenclature will be explained further on. I have thought it necessary to do so at the <lbinfo n="sugges+tion"/>
suggestion of several friends, and have derived considerable help from the great {%Vācaspatya%} which I have
usually followed, except where the etymology given therein appeared to me to be purely arbitrary or <lbinfo n="fan+ciful"/>
fanciful. Philological comparisons have been given only where useful and noteworthy. The work also gives <lbinfo n="in+formation"/>
information about words which, it is believed, will be very useful, especially to the University student; {%e. g%}.
see the words {#apsaras, asura, veda, maMqala, mAnasa, haMsa#} &c. Some of the most common {%Nyāyas%} or Maxims have
been collected under the word {#nyAya#} for easy reference; {%e. g%}. see {#kAkatAlIyanyAya, daMqApUpanyAya, sTAlIpulAkanyAya#}
&c. To add to the usefulness of the Dictionary I have added at the end three Appendices. The first is on
Sanskrit Prosody which attempts to give in a clear and intelligible form all the common metres with <lbinfo n="Defini+tions"/>
Definitions, Schemes in Gaṇas, and Examples. In the preparation of this Appendix I have chiefly
drawn upon the two popular works on Prosody, the Vṛttaratnākara and Chando-Mañjari,
but some common metres omitted in those works have been added from the illustrations
found in the works of Māgha, Bhāravi, Daṇḍin, Bhaṭṭi, Śūdraka &c. Colebrooke's Essay on Sanskrit Metres
has also given me occasional help. The second Appendix gives the dates, writings &c. of some of the <lbinfo n="im+portant"/>
important Sanskrit writers such as Kālidāsa, Bhavabhūti, Bāṇa. Here I have selected only those names about
which something definite-something more than mere guesses and surmises-is known, and I have derived
some hints from the Introduction to Vallabhadeva's Subhāṣitāvali edited by Dr. Peterson and Paṇḍita
Durgā Prasāda, and from Prof. Max Müller's ‘India: what it can teach us,’ for which my thanks are due
to the authors of both the works. The third Appendix gives the most important names in the
ancient Geography of India with identifications on the modern map wherever ascertained, and
in this part of the work I have to cordially acknowledge the help I have derived from <lbinfo n="Cun+ningham"/>
Cunningham's Ancient Geography, but particularly from Mr. Borooah's Essay prefixed to the third
volume of his English-Sanskrit Dictionary. I had at first intended to add two alphabctical indexes to
the principal events and personages occurring in the Rāmāyaṇa and Mahābhārata, but I have
had to abandon the project, as the publication of the Dictionary has already been delayed on account of 
[Page-3+ 50]
various causes over which I had no control. In short, I have endeavoured to make the PRACTICAL <lbinfo n="SAN+SKRIT"/>
SANSKRIT-ENGLISH DICTIONARY as complete, comprehensive, and encyclopedic as was possible within the limits
of a single compact volume by condensing a very large amount of matter by means of suitable <lbinfo n="typographi+cal"/>
typographical and other arrangements, and I hope it will be found to be a practically useful and reliable guide in
the study of the Sanskrit language.
<P>There is one point which will not fail to strike a careful reader of this Dictionary, which is that there is
not the same fulness of treatment in the later portion as in the first 300 or 400 pages. After the vowels
had been printed off, I found that they covered no less than 364 pages by themselves, and if the <lbinfo n="remain+ing"/>
remaining letters of the alphabet had been treated with the same fulness, the volume would have increased to
about 2000 pages, and the publication of the work itself would have been delayed by at least one year more.
It is obvious that neither time, nor the very cheap price at which the work was offered to subscribers,
would have enabled me to carry on the work of compilation on the same scale; and I was, therefore, obliged
to endeavour to curtail the matter by occasionally substituting references for quotations without at the same
time marring the usefulness of the work, and by abridging explanations of words and the information given
about them, while in some cases I have had to keep back matter originally intended for the volume. I hope,
however, that this has not to any great extent affected the practical usefulness of the Dictionary, and
I trust that if time and circumstances permit, I shall be in a position to make the second edition much more
useful, complete, and comprehensive than the first.
<P>The plan and arrangement of the work will be best understood from the ‘Directions’ which follow.
Verbs formed by prefixing prepositions to roots are arranged in the alphabetical order of the prepositions so
affixed; {%<ab>e. g.</ab>%} {#prasTA#} or {#saMsTA#} must be looked for not under {#sTA#}, but in its own alphabetical order, and at the head
of its own group of derivatives. This system has been followed in this Dictionary with a view to save <lbinfo n="re+petition"/>
repetition of equivalents under the derivatives from a root. But if, on trial, it be found to be practically <lbinfo n="in+convenient"/>
inconvenient, it may be abandoned in the second edition. As in the English-Sanskrit Dictionary, I have
here throughout used the {%anusvāra%} instead of the nasals, ({%e. g. anga%} or {%santāpa%} is written not as {#aNga, santApa#},
but as {#aMga, saMtApa#}), which practice, whatever may be said with regard to its correctness, is very convenient for
purposes of printing. The several contrivances used to effect saving in space will be understood by the
reader after very short practice.
<P>It now remains for me to do the grateful duty of acknowledging the help I have derived from <lbinfo n="differ+ent"/>
different sources. And in doing so I must give the first place to the great Sanskrit encyclopædia, the <lbinfo n="Vāchas+patya"/>
Vāchaspatya of Professor Tārānātha Tarkavācaspati. I have constantly kept it by my side and have freely <lbinfo n="avail+ed"/>
availed myself of the information contained in it-of course with large curtailments-though I have had to <lbinfo n="supple+ment"/>
supplement it myself wherever it was found to be defective or insufficient. Several words and senses of words not given
in the existing Sanskrit-English lexicons, as also some quotations, particularly from Udbhaṭa and Purāṇas,
have been borrowed from the same work. The Sanskrit-English Dictionary of Professor Monier Williams is
the next work to which I have been greatly indebted. It has been a constant source of help to me, and I
have frequently adopted his renderings of words, compound expressions &c., where I found them better
than those I myself had to suggest. And though there is a good deal in this Dictionary that is not to be
found in that work, and though the plan and scope of the two are essentially different, yet I must
gratefully acknowledge the great assistance I have often derived from the learned Professor's invaluable <lbinfo n="Dic+tionary"/>
Dictionary. The last work to which also my grateful acknowledgments are due is the German Wörterbuch of
Drs. Roth and Bothlingk. The chief distinguishing feature of that great work is that it abounds with
quotations and references dealing with almost every branch of Sanskrit literature, but a careful reader will
easily see that the works belonging to Vedic literature, such as the four Vedas, Upaniṣads,
Brāhmaṇas, Āraṇyakas &c., have been comparatively more copiously drawn upon by the
authors than works belonging to the post-Vedic literature. A glance at the contents of this
Dictionary will show that I have drawn upon works seldom or not at all referred to in the
Wörterbuch; such as the Mahāvīracarita, Mālatī-Mādhava, Uttararāmacarita, Kādambarī, <lbinfo n="Śiśupāla+vadha"/>
Śiśupālavadha, Kirātārjunīya, Mudrārākṣasa, Veṇīsaṃhāra, Ratnāvalī, Kāvyaprakāśa, Śāṃkarabhāṣya, Bhāminīvilāsa,
Vikramāṅkadevacarita, Gaṅgālaharī &c. Indeed, the great majority of quotations and references are 
[Page-4+ 27]
from my own collection made during the last seven or eight years; and I have even been obliged to keep back
a large number of them for want of space. But I must frankly acknowledge that I have freely availed
myself of the quotations and references in that Dictionary, where my own collection was defective, particularly
in the case of Vedic and Paurāṇic works. I have also occasionally consulted the Dictionaries of H. H.
Wilson and Benfey, the former supplying some happy renderings of technical or obscure
words. To these authors, as well as to the authors and editors of several other works, which are
too many to be here mentioned, from which I have derived occasional help in one form or another, my
most grateful thanks are due.
<P>In conclusion I may be permitted to express the hope that the PRACTICAL SANSKRIT-ENGLISH <lbinfo n="DICTION+ARY"/>
DICTIONARY-which has attempted to give in 1200 closely printed pages of this size matter at least equal in point of
{%quantity%} to that given by Prof. Monier Williams in his Dictionary, but in point of {%quality%} more reliable,
varied, and practically useful, in my humble opinion-will serve the purpose I have had in view in
compiling it; namely, to render to the student of Sanskrit nearly the same service that Webster's or Ogilvie's
Dictionary does to the student of English. I have tried to make it easily accessible to the public by issuing
a Popular Edition priced at 7 Rupees-a price too low, I believe, for so much matter; while the Library <lbinfo n="Edi+tion"/>
Edition which, containing the same matter, is printed on superior paper and in better style, and will also
have superior binding, will best answer the purposes of the well-to-do persons who can afford to
spend 10 or 11 Rupees for such object. In a work of this kind I know there must be several <lbinfo n="de+fects"/>
defects and also errors both of omission and commission, and if such persons as will do me the honour of using
this Dictionary will be so good as to point out to me places which require corrections, additions or <lbinfo n="improve+ments"/>
improvements, I shall be very happy to give the suggestions my best consideration in the second edition. But if
the Dictionary, even in its present form, be found to be a useful publication, I shall consider my labours
more than amply repaid, and shall feel quite refreshed to devote my humble self again, if need be, to
the service of the Sanskrit-reading public; for, says the poet,

[Page-5+ 35]
<H>DIRECTIONS TO BE STUDIED BEFORE USING THIS DICTIONARY.
<P>1. Words and their derivatives are arranged in the following order: first the {%radical%} or primitive
word in large black type in all its different parts of speech; and then the several derivatives in smaller type.
In some cases these derivatives are given in their own alphabetical order for the sake of clearness.
<P>2. The different parts of speech of a word are indicated by large black dashes, after which the <lbinfo n="nomi+native"/>
nominative singular of the part of speech is usually given, or the letters {%m., f., n%}. or {%ind%}. are put after the dash, the
leading word being given only once. Where a word is used as an adjective and also as a substantive, the
senses of the adjective are invariably given first; {%e. g%}. {#vIra, sADu, sat#}. The same is done in the case of <lbinfo n="com+pounds"/>
compounds, but within brackets.
<P>3. Where two words, though identical in form, differ entirely in meaning, they are generally repeated
as separate words; {%e. g%}. {#hA, hi#}. In a few cases they have been grouped together.
<P>4. Words which are used as adverbs, but derived by case-inflections from a noun or adjective, are
given under the noun or adjective, {%e. g%}. {#uttareRa#} under {#uttara#}. In some cases they are given within
brackets before the compounds, if any.
<P>5. The several meanings of a word, where they can be sufficiently distinguished from one another, are
given separately and marked by black Arabic figures. Mere {%shades%} of meaning are not considered as separate
senses, but in such cases several synonyms are given under the same meaning, from which the reader will
have to make his choice. Where the shades of meaning are sufficiently broad, they are numbered as separate
meanings.
<P>6. The meanings of words are arranged in the order of their importance and frequency of use. It has
not, of course, been possible to do so in {%every%} case, ut the system has been generally followed.
<P>7. ({%a%}) Compounds are grouped under the first word in the compounds, in the alphabetical order of
their {%second%} members, the black dash before them denoting that first word; {%e, g%}. {#--hotra#} under {#agni#} means  <lbinfo n="agni#hotra"/>
{#agnihotra, --aDikArin#} under {#uttara#} means {#uttarADikArin#}.
<P>{%N. B%}. In giving compounds, the changes, which the final letters undergo, {%e. g%}. the dropping, <lbinfo n="assimila+tion"/>
assimilation of letters &c. are assumed; {%e. g%}. {#--apara#} under {#pUrva#} stands for {#pUrvApara, --gatiH#} under {#aDas#}, for {#aDogatiH#} &c. In
some cases the compound words, where not easily intelligible, are given in full within brackets; see {#Danus, punas#},
{#vAc#}. &c.
<P>({%b%}) Where a compound itself is used as the first member of other compounds, these letter are given
immediately after, their second member being preceded by °which represents the first compound; {%e. g%}. {#°iMdra#},
{#°rAja#} &c. given under {#dvi#} stand not for {#dvIMdra#} or {#dvirAja#}, but for {#dvijeMdra#} or {#dvijarAja#}.
<P>({%c%}) All {%aluk%} compounds ({%e. g%}. {#Atmanepada, kuSeSaya, parasmEpada, manasija, dAsyAH putraH, hfdispfS#} &c.) are
given separately in their proper places, but under the radical word.
<P>8. All words formed by Kṛt or Taddhita affixes are given separately; thus {#kUlaMkaza, BayaMkara, annamaya#},
{#prAtastana, himavat#} &c. will be found not as compounds under {#kUla, Baya#} &c. but as separate words. 
[Page-6+ 39]
<P>9. ({%a%}). In the case of substantives the nominative singular, wherever it may at once denote the
gender, is given throughout, the {%visarga%}, unless followed by {%f.%}, indicating masculine gender, and the
{%anusvāra%} neuter gender. Where the nominative singular is not indicative of the gender, it is specified as
{%m. f%}. or {%n%}. as the case may be. All substantives ending in consonants have their genders specified as {%m. f%}.
or {%n%}.
<P>({%b%}) The feminine forms of nouns are usually given as separate leading words, but in some cases,
especially in the first five or six hundred pages, they are given under the leading word after the masculine
gender. But where the fem. base enters into compounds, it is invariably given separately; {%e. g%}. {#ajA#}.
<P>10. In the case of adjectives the simple base only is given. The feminine of the majority of <lbinfo n="adjec+tives"/>
adjectives in {#a#} ends in {#A#}, and adjectives ending in {#i#} or {#u#} have generally the same base for all genders. In all
such cases the simple base is given, the feminine being formed according to similar substantive bases. All
irregular feminines are, however, denoted within brackets. Adjectives ending in {#t, n#}, or {#s#}, form their
feminines regularly in {#tI, nI#}, or {#sI#}; where irregular, they are denoted within brackets.
<P>11. ({%a%}). In the case of verbs, the Arabic figure before P., A. and U. denotes the conjugation
to which the root belongs; P. denoting Parasmaipada, A. Ātmanepada, and U. Ubhayapada (P. and A.).
Den. stands for Denominative, and here the 3rd pers. sing. present tense is given throughout.
<P>({%b%}). Under each root the 3rd person singular present tense and of the Perfect, Aorist, two Futures
and Infinitive in the case of important roots, and the past passive participle wherever noteworthy, are given
throughout. The forms of the {%Passive, Causal%} and {%Desiderative%}, wherever noteworthy, are given after them,
or after the senses of the primitive base, where there is any peculiarity in their senses.
<P>({%c%}). Verbs formed by prefixing prepositions to roots are given separately in their own alphabetical
order, except in cases where there are no derivatives from such verbs.
<P>({%d%}). Roots sometimes change their form or {%pada%} (voice) or both, when used in particular senses,
or when preceded by particular prepositions. Such changes are denoted within brackets.
<P>({%e%}). When a root belongs to different conjugations with different meanings, Roman figures are used
to mark this difference, (cf. {#as, gup, hA#} &c.), the root being repeated only once.
<P>12. ({%a%}). All possible derivatives from a word are not always given when they may be easily <lbinfo n="sup+plied"/>
supplied, more especially in the case of potential passive participles (formed by {#tavya, anIya#} and {#ya#}), present
participles, and abstract nouns from adjectives (formed by adding {#tA, tva#} or {#ya#}). Where there is any <lbinfo n="pecu+liarity"/>
peculiarity either in the formation or meaning of these derivatives, they are given. But in many cases the <lbinfo n="stu+dent"/>
student will have to supply the forms according to the general rules given in Grammar.
<P>({%b%}). Similarly all the equivalents given under the radical word are not always repeated under the <lbinfo n="deri+vatives"/>
derivatives; they may, if necessary, be ascertained by a reference to the radical word.
<P>13. Mythological allusions are explained in {%small%} type in the body of the work between rectangular
brackets []. Here long vowels like ā, ī, ū, and letters of the lingual class, as also {#f#} and {#Sa#} are, for the
convenience of the press, denoted by corresponding {%italic%} letters; {%e. g%}. Pāṇḍava and Kṛpī stand for
{#pAMqava#} and {#kfpI#}.
<P>14. Metres and information about literary and geographical names are given in the Appendices at
the end.
