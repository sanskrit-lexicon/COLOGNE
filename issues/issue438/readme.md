# Trial to create pwg.html from pwg.xml 

1. cp ../pwg/pywork/pwg.xml issues/issue438/temp_pwg.xml
2. cp ../pwg/pywork/pwg.dtd issues/issue438/temp_pwg.dtd
3. Create a sample temp_pwg_0 by taking 10 entries.
4. Open https://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/PWGScan/2020/web/webtc2/index.php and search for those entries to identify the HTML which is expected.
