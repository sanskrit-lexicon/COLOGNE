This folder describes a local installation of Cologne dictionaries on
a Macintosh computer.  This installation was done in January 2023, via
collaboration between Peter Scharf and Jim Funderburk.

Peter Scharf provides notes:
* macCologneDictInstallation installation of php, and configuration.
* notes.txt  Installation of Cologne dictionary displays, homepage, etc.
  * download1.sh  (revised to download2.sh)
  * download2.sh  downloads and installs one dictionary
  * .htaccess  So simple-search link of homepage works.

Note: This local installation is a variation of that described in the
 'xampp' foloder. The main difference is that csl-orig, csl-pywork,
 and csl-websanlexicon repositories are NOT installed; they are not
 needed for dictionary displays.
