<H>PREFACE TO THE EDITION OF 1962
<P>The » Alphabetical Register of Sanskrit Works and Authors «, based mainly on the Catalogues
and Lists of Indian manuscripts published up to 1902, serves as an indispensable standard
reference work for all those who are interested in Sanskrit literature.
<P>It was due to the brilliant intellect and the indefatigable endeavours of Theodor Aufrecht
that Indology was provided with this reliable guide through an intricate mass of material.
<P>The first two parts of the original edition of 1891 and 1896 were printed with the financial
assistance of the Deutsche Morgenländische Gesellschaft (the “German Oriental Society”), where-
as the third part was published in 1903 with the help of the Academies of Göttingen, Leipzig,
Munich and Vienna.
<P>For a long time the CATALOGUS CATALOGORUM was out of print, a circumstance deeply regretted
by many scholars, institutions and libraries. Now that the new edition becomes available, our
thanks are due to the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (the “German Research Association”)
for its liberal support which permitted the reprinting of the masterly work of Th. Aufrecht.

<P>We shall hardly ever succeed in accomplishing for Sanskrit Literature what has already been done to
good purpose in several important branches of Arabic, namely to give an accurate description of its works, their
authors, and the time these have lived in. The compass of the former is so vast, extending as it does over a
period of 2500 years, and the lack of interest in historical truth in India is so great, that difficulties meet the
inquirer at every step. The attempt, however, to give an account of the whole of Sanskrit Literature as contained
in Manuscripts deposited in India as well as in Europe, was to be made, and it fell to my lot to undertake this
task. The present work is the result of a labour of nearly thirty years, and its imperfections must be excused
owing to the nature of the materials at my disposal, and my absence from the great centres of Manuscripts and
Books, the Libraries of Berlin and of the India Office in London. A work of this kind is doomed to remain
incomplete. Not to speak of India, where new discoveries are made daily, it seems almost incredible that the
Libraries of the Asiatic Society of Calcutta, of Paris, of the British Museum, of the Asiatic Society in London,
still remain without a Catalogue of their Sanskrit MSS., and that information about these can only be obtained
by personal inquiry, or by consulting their written lists which are full of errors. From my own experience I
know that bundles of Sanskrit MSS. are scattered in Public and Private Libraries of England without attracting
any notice. On this account it is possible that in Europe discoveries of important Sanskrit works can still be made.
<P>The title Catalogus Catalogorum merely serves to express the sources from which the present work is
derived. By the favour of the Government in India, no less than by that of private friends, I was supplied with
what, I believe, is nearly a complete collection of printed lists of Sanskrit MSS. To arrange and sift the matter
therein contained required a great amount of perseverance and discretion. Fortunately, some of the Catalogues
which have appeared in Europe, and a few published by some truly learned Scholars in India, have often
afforded clues to escape from mazes of otherwise inextricable confusion. The Catalogues and Lists I have made
use of are the following.
<P>1. {%Jones.%} A Catalogue of Sanscrit and other Oriental Manuscripts presented to the Royal Society by
Sir William and Lady Jones. Printed in Sir William Jones' Works. London 1807. 8. Vol. XIII, p. 401--15.
This is a small collection of MSS., which were all copied for Sir William Jones. It is now being kept in the
Library of the India Office. Quoted by pages. This mode of quotation is adopted in all cases where no remark
is made to the contrary.
<P>2. {%Mack.%} Mackenzie Collection. A descriptive Catalogue of the Oriental Manuscripts collected by the
late Lieut. Col. Colin Mackenzie. By H. H. Wilson. Calcutta 1828. 8. This collection was made in the South,
and the greater part of it is now in the Library of the India Office.
<P>3. {%Copenh.%} Codices Indici Bibliothecae Regiae Havniensis enumerati et descripti a N. L. Westergaard.
Havniae 1846. 4. Principally from the collection made by Erasmus Rask. 
[Page1-802+ 42]
<P>4. {%Pet.%} Verzeichniss der auf Indien bezüglichen Handschriften und Holzdrucke im Asiatischen Museum,
von Otto Böhtlingk. Printed in Das Asiatische Museum zu St. Petersburg von Dr. Bernh. Dorn. St. Petersburg
1846. 8. I was unable to obtain some other lists of Sanskrit Mss., which are extant at St. Petersburg.
<P>5. {%IO.%} The Library of the India Office in London contains the collections of Colebrooke, Wilkins,
Taylor, the Gaikawar, Johnson, Fleet, Ballantyne, Burnell, and others. When my work went to press, only the
first part of the valuable Catalogue by Professor Eggeling, containing the Vedic Manuscripts, was then published.
By the courtesy of the Author I was allowed the use of the proof-sheets of the second part, and those of the
third part as far as page 552. My work would have been materially benefited, could I have waited for the
completion of the whole. But there is no prospect of this Catalogue being finished for perhaps another ten years.
The loss thereby caused has to a small extent been remedied by my having examined about 1150 volumes while
residing in England, and afterwards during my occasional visits to London.
<P>6. {%W.%} Verzeichniss der Sanskrit-Handschriften (der Königlichen Bibliothek in Berlin) von A. Weber.
Berlin 1853. 4. This is a pattern of what a Catalogue ought to be, and it deals with MSS. which in their
bulk are not surpassed in value by any other collection in Europe.
<P>7. {%Oxf.%} Catalogus Codicum Sanscriticorum Bibliothecae Bodleianae. Confecit Th. Aufrecht. Oxonii
1864. 4. Since this Catalogue was printed, the Bodleian Library, with the exception of Hultzsch's collection,
has not much increased its store of Sanskrit MSS. These additional MSS. I have examined and have, with only
a few exceptions, entered in the present book.
<P>8. {%Cambr.%} A Catalogue of Sanskrit Manuscripts in the Library of Trinity College, Cambridge. By
Th. Aufrecht. Cambridge 1869. 8. The University Library in Cambridge has collected a considerable number
of Sanskrit works, which ought to be made known to the Learned.
<P>9. {%Paris.%} No printed Catalogue is in existence. Fortunately, I was able to avail myself of a written
alphabetical Catalogue compiled by S. Munk, of which an abridged copy was made for Lassen by Goldstücker.
Mr. Feer was obliging enough to send me in 1886 a list of later additions under the title of ‘Liste des titres
de Manuscrits Sanskrits ajoutes au Catalogue de Munk, augmentée des titres des Manuscrits en caracteres autres
que le Devanāgari et le Bengali qui ne sont pas donnés dans le Catalogue’. I have great pleasure in recording
my thanks to Mr. Féer publicly.--Both lists are unfortunately replete with errors. Burnouf's MSS. are
enumerated in the catalogue of sale of his books. They are few and not valuable. The small Catalogue by
Hamilton and Lagles, Paris 1807. 8. I could not procure on the Continent.--Quoted by the numbers of
entry in the written Catalogue.
<P>10. {%Hall.%} A contribntion towards an Index to the Bibliography of the Indian Philosophical systems.
By Fitzedward Hall. Calcutta 1859. 8. It would be presumption on my part to speak in praise of a work
which by universal consent is considered to be unique and perfect in its particular department.
<P>11. {%L.%} Notices of Sanskrit MSS. by Rājendralāla Mitra. Calcutta 1871--90. Nine volumes in 8, and
the first part of the tenth. This is decidedly the best analysis of Sanskrit Mss., which up to the present time
has been made by a Native of India. The copious extracts are very useful, and enable the attentive reader to
judge of the contents of a work, even where he is deserted by the English text. The indefatigable industry of
the Editor deserves every kind of commendation.--Quoted by numbers.
<P>12. {%Khn.%} A classified alphabetical Catalogue of Sanskrit MSS. in the Southern division of the Bombay
Presidency. Compiled by F. Kielhorn. Fascicle I. Bombay 1869. 8.
<P>13. {%K.%} A Catalogue of Sanskrit MSS. existing in the Central Provinces. Edited by F. Kielhorn.
Nagpur 1874. 8. 
[Page1-803+ 43]
<P>14. {%Kh.%} Report on the search for Sanskrit MSS. in the Bombay Presidency during the year 1880--81.
By F. Kielhorn. Bombay 1881. 8.
<P>15. {%B.%} A Catalogue of Sanskrit Manuscripts contained in the Private Libraries of Gujarāt, Kāṭhiāvād,
Kachchh, Sindh, and Khāndeś. Compiled under the Superintendence of G. Bühler. Four fascicles. Bombay
1871--73. 8.
<P>16. {%Report.%} Detailed Report of a tour in search of Sanskrit MSS. made in Kāśmīr, Rajputana, and
Central India. By G. Bühler. Bombay 1877. 8. This is a publication of great importance. Whole branches
of literature, till then scarcely known, were here brought to light and set forth in a masterly manner. The best
works published in the Kāvyamālā are printed from MSS. brought by Bühler from this journey, and Sanskrit
Scholars in Europe have also eagerly availed themselves of them.
<P>17. {%Ben.%} A Catalogue of MSS. in the Library of the Benares Sanskrit College. Published as a
supplement to the Pandit Voll. III--IX. Benares 1864--74.
<P>18. {%Lgr.%} A descriptive Catalogue of Sanskrit MSS. in the Library of the Asiatic Society of Bengal.
Part first. Grammar. Edited by Rājendralāla Mitra. Calcutta 1877. 8. Written with more pretence than
knowledge.
<P>19. {%Bik.%} A Catalogue of Sanskrit Manuscripts in the Library of His Highness the Mahārāja of Bikāner.
Compiled by Rājendralāla Mitra. Calcutta 1880. 8.
<P>20. {%Tüb.%} Verzeichniss Indischer Handschriften der Königlichen Universitāts-Bibliothek in Tübingen.
Anhang. Indische Handschriften der Königlichen Oeffentlichen Bibliothek in Stuttgart. Von R. Roth. Tübingen
1865. 4.
<P>21. {%Haug.%} Verzeichniss der orientalischen Handschriften aus dem Nachlasse des Professor Dr. Martin
Haug in München. München 1876. 4. This Catalogue was hastily compiled by Dr. Georg Orterer.
<P>22. {%Kāṭm.%} List of Sanskrit works supposed by the Nepalese Pandits to be rare in the Napalese
Libraries at Khatmandoo. 14 pages in 8, signed R. Lawrence, Resident. Nepal Residency, The 2nd of
August, 1868.
<P>23. {%Pheh.%} Phehariśt Saṃskṛtake Pustakoṅkā, 16 pages in 8, without any further statement.
<P>24. {%Rādh.%} Pustakānāṃ Sūcīpatram. 48 pages in 8. At the end we find: likhitaṃ Paṇḍitarājārāma-
śāstriṇā Kāśmīravāsinā. This important collection of MSS. belonged to the late Paṇḍit Rādhākṛṣṇa of Lahore,
who was famous not only for his enlightened views, but also for his great knowledge of Sanskrit lore.
<P>25. {%NW.%} A Catalogue of Sanskrit Manuscripts in Private Libraries of the North-West Provinces.
Part I. Benares 1874. 8.
<P>26. {%Oudh%} 1876. 1877. List of Sanskrit Manuscripts discovered in Oudh during the year 1876.

III--XIII. Subsequent numbers for 1881 (XIV), 1882 (XV), 1883 (XVI), 1884 (XVII), 1885 (XVIII), 1887 (XIX).

<P>28. {%NP.%} A Catalogue of Sanskrit Manuscripts in Private Libraries of the North-Western Provinces.
Parts I--X. Allahabad 1877--86. 8.
<P>29. {%Brl.%} Catalogue of a collection of Sanskrit Manuscripts by A. C. Burnell. Part I. Vedic Manuscripts.
London 1870. 8. These MSS. were presented to the India Office, London.
<P>30. {%Burnell.%} A classified Index to the Sanskrit MSS. in the Palace at Tanjore, by A. C. Burnell.
London 1880. 8. Any work proceeding from the pen of such a scholar as Burnell may be presumed to be 
[Page1-804+ 41]
excellent. We only regret in this Catalogue that the author has comparatively rarely given the beginnings of
the works he has described.
<P>31. {%Bl.%} Report on Sanskrit MSS. 1872--73. Seven, and seventeen pages. Bombay 1874. 8.
<P>32. {%BA.%} Report of Sanskrit MSS. 1874--75, by G. Bühler. 21 pages in 8. Girgaum 1875.

we do not possess many more like it.--Quoted by numbers.
<P>37. {%P.%} Lists of the Sanskrit manuscripts purchased for Government during the years 1877--78 and
1869--78, and a list of the manuscripts purchased from May to November 1881. By F. Kielhorn. Dated Poona,

Punjab, examined during the year 1881--82 by Pandit Kāṣi Nāth Kunte. 4 pages of preface, and 12 pages

Bonnae 1876. 4.
<P>44. {%Jac.%} Liste der indischen Handschriften im Besitze des Prof. H. Jacobi. Printed in Zeitschrift der

<P>48. {%Oppert.%} Lists of Sanskrit Manuscripts in Private Libraries of Southern India by Gustav Oppert.

R. Bhandarkar. Bombay 1888. 8. This is a useful reprint of 18 previously published lists, only the first out

Fort William, the Asiatic Society in Calcutta, etc. Calcutta 1838. 8.
<P>While writing this, I received the 20th part of the Catalogue of Oudh MSS., and the first part of the
10th volume of Rājendralāla Mitra's Notices. Not wishing to encumber the Additions, I must leave these two books
and any other materials which may hereafter be published for a later opportunity.
<P>The abbreviations used are for the most part quite clear. an. anonymous, dh. dharma, fr. fragmentary,
gr. grammatical, ny. nyāya, tantr. tantric. Skm. is the Sūktikarṇāmṛta by Śrīdharadāsa, of which I have copied
the only two MSS. which hitherto have been discovered. Sbhv. is the Subhāṣitāvali by Vallabhadeva. With Śp.
I refer to my analysis of the Śārṅgadharapaddhati in Vol. 27 (1873) of the Zeitschrift of the German Oriental
Society, with Rāyamukuṭa to my Paper on his Padacandrikā, ibid. Vol. 28 (1874) p. 109.

<P>The Secretary of State for India has supported the present undertaking by a grant of L. 120. The
German Oriental Society has generously undertaken to publish at its own expense a work which originally was
calculated not to exceed much beyond thirty sheets.
<P>There remains only the pleasing duty to thank those Gentlemen who were always ready to answer any
questions I addressed to them regarding those MSS. about which I entertained doubts. They are Dr. A. Barth
in Paris, to whom I acknowledge myself to be under especial obligation, Professor Eggeling in Edinburgh, Dr. Hoernle
in Calcutta, Dr. Klatt in Berlin, Professor E. Kuhn in Munich, Dr. R. Rost in London.

<P>A number of Catalogues and Lists of Sanskrit Manuscripts having appeared since 1891, I was induced
to publish a second volume of my Catalogus Catalogorum, hoping it will prove as useful as the first. These two
volumes contain the bulk of Sanskrit works from all parts of India. Of course new discoveries will be made in
time, and accurate descriptions will correct many of the entries. In the present state of our knowledge of Sanskrit
Literature mere lists of names are of little value, and lead only to confusion. We require an accurate statement
of the contents of a work, its author and his parentage, and when possible the year of its composition. This has
been done in the best Catalogues we possess. The Catalogues extracted in this second volume are the following.
<P>1. {%ASB.%} Journal of Asiatic Society of Bengal.
<P>2. {%Bhau Dāji.%} Catalogue of Manuscripts and Books belonging to the Bhau Dāji Memorial. Bombay
1882. 8^0. Quoted according to pages.--This is a mere list, arranged according to the number of MSS. I
give a specimen.
<P>165. Pitṛsūktamantra | ... | Veda | 14 leaves.
Piṭhorī-Vrata | Vyāsa | Purāṇa | 2 to 7.
(Skanda-Purāṇa).

<P>The greater number of Sanskrit works have been extracted.

the Superintendence of R. G. Bhandarkar. Part I. Bombay 1893. 8^0.

nātha | 4 copies.

candra | 2.
<HI1>Nānārthasaṃgraha | Do. | Haricandra | 4.
<HI1>Nāmakaraṇa | Prayoga |...| 1.
<HI>Only a selected number of entries could be received. This collection, which contains many important works,
deserves to be properly catalogued. 
[Page2-244+ 43]
<P>11. {%Hz.%} Reports on Sanskrit Manuscripts in Southern India by E. Hultzsch. No. 1. Madras 1895. 8^0.
<P>12. {%IO.%} Catalogue of Sanskrit Manuscripts in the Library of the India Office. Part IV. Philesophy
and Tantra. By Ernst Windisch und Julius Eggeling. London 1894. 4^0.--Part V. Medicine. Astronomy
and Mathematics. Architecture and Technical Science. By Julius Eggeling. London 1896. 4^0.--I an indebted
to Professor Eggeling for obliging me with notices of some MSS. which will be described in Part VI.
<P>13. {%L.%} Notices of Sanskrit MSS. Volume X. Calcutta 1892. 8^0.
<P>14. {%Lund.%} De codicibus nonnullis Indicis, qui in Bibliotheca Universitatis Lundensis asservantur,
scripsit Hjalmar Edgren. Lunds Univ. Aarskrift Tom. XIX. 4^0.--Altogether 15 MSS.
<P>15. {%Oudh XX.%} A Catalogue of Sanskrit MSS. existing in Oudh Province for the year 1888. By
Paṇḍita Devī Prasāda. Allahabad 1890. 8^0. -- XXI. For the year 1889. Allahabad 1893. 8^0. -- XXII. For
the year 1890. Allahabad 1893. 8^0. -- Quoted by pages.
<P>16. {%Peters.%} A fourth Report of operations in search of Sanskrit MSS. in the Bombay Circle, April
1886--March 1892. By Professor Peters Peterson. Bombay 1894. 8^0.
<P>17. {%Rgb.%} Report on the search for Sanskrit MSS. in the Bombay Presidency during the years 1884--85,
1885--86 and 1886--87. By Ramkriṣna Gopal Bhandarkar. Bombay 1894. 8^0. A mere list without extracts.
<P>18. {%Stein.%} Catalogue of the Sanskrit Manuscripts in the Raghunātha Temple Library of his Highness
the Maharāja of Jammu and Kashmir. Prepared by M. A. Stein. Bombay 1894. 4^0. A very valuable and
accurate work.
<P>19. {%Ulwar.%} Catalogue of the Sanskrit MSS. in the Library of his Highness the Maharāja of Ulwar by
Peter Peterson. Bombay 1892. 4^0. This Catalogue is very useful on account of the many extracts given. They
fill pages {#1--261#}. It is to be regretted that no distinctive signs have been adopted in the description of the
MSS. This causes often great obscurity and puzzles the reader. Thus no. 1254 Asvadanaprayoga, meant for
Aśvadānaprayoga; X no. 1846 Purahadipatakacakrantayoga; no. 1990 Saptanadikacakra, etc. A statement of the
number of leaves, the character of writing and the probable age of the MSS. would have been welcome.
<P>20. {%Weber.%} Handschriften-Verzeichniss der Königlichen Bibliothek zu Berlin. II, 3. Berlin 1892. 4^0.
At the end Weber describes a number of additional Sanskrit MSS. (No. 2028--2298). The most important have
been noticed.
<P>Finally I would remark that in many instances a full description has been given in the first volume, and
that in consequence it should be consulted in using the second. Peterson's Ulwar Catalogue arrived too late to
be embodied in the text, and therefore forms the Appendix.
<P>The Sanskrit Alphabet has been transcribed as follows:
